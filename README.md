# Framework Boilerplate
## by Jari van Kaam

this project is made to simplify and speed up the process of creating a `new project`. It is very loosely based on a framework I use in my internship. It is not meant to be used as a framework, but as a starting point for your `own project`. 

## Features
 - preconfigured watch commands for sass(scss) based css coding and Typescript.
 - preconfigured router(W.I.P.).
 - ordend file structure.
 - laravel like naming conventions in folder names.

## Installation
- clone the repository
- run `npm i` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- to watch for changes in folder __private/scss__ run `npm run watch:css` or `yarn watch:css`
- to watch for changes in folder __private/ts__ run `npm run watch:ts` or `yarn watch:ts`
- to scan the project use __npm run test__ or __yarn test__
